# Epic Fight Animation & Model exporter

This plugin is specially created for Minecraft - Epic Fight development, in blender 4.0 version.

## About the bug and supports

Since this exporter is designed for a very restricted purpose, I won't provide any support. The mesh, armature, and animation data must be created first to export the model properly.

## Changelog

- 1.0.3: Update for Blender 4.0
- 1.0.2: Added the part ditingushing function by the vertex group it will store all vectices in the vertex group which is the name ends with "\_mesh"
- 1.0.1: Separated the option "export model" to "export mesh" and "export armature". This is because the armature data is useless to armors. Changed the hidden joints not to be exported
- 1.0.0: Created
